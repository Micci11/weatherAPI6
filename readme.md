# Weather API

This is a weather dashboard that allows users to search for a city and view the current and future weather conditions for that city. The dashboard also keeps track of the user's search history and allows them to easily switch between previously searched cities.

# Getting started

To use this weather dashboard, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You will be presented with a search form where you can enter the name of a city.

# Using the weather API

- Searching for a city
    - To search for a city, simply enter the name of the city in the search form and click the "Search" button. The dashboard will retrieve the current weather conditions and the 5-day forecast for the city from an external API.

- Viewing current weather conditions
    - After you search for a city, you will be presented with the current weather conditions for that city. This will include the city name, the date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.

- Viewing future weather conditions
    - In addition to the current weather conditions, you can also view the future weather conditions for the searched city. The dashboard will display a 5-day forecast that includes the date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.

- Viewing search history
    - The dashboard keeps track of your search history and displays it on the left-hand side of the screen. You can click on any city in the search history to view its current and future weather conditions again.
